# Intro
Hadiel's family was killed by the [[2-World/Plaga Cambiante\|Plaga Cambiante]] and Hadiel fell ill, but [[2-World/Pantheon/Mephestus, Hierarch of Hell & Death Herself\| Lady Death]] took pity on him and gave him power. This helped him realise that the doomsday cult was wrong and did not really support [[2-World/Pantheon/Mephestus, Hierarch of Hell & Death Herself\| her]]. In return for the power Hadiel had to kill those who deserved death.
