The guilds of  Anthor are political groups that have formed over centuries to compete with each other, causing a great many rivalries. These guilds form the backbone of the economic and political landscape of Anthor. Each guild holds the power to sway elections or throw crucial deals all whilst remaining quite secretive . These guilds often form small temporary alliances but they never stay friends for long and are always vying for power.
