A fearless, giant female form, skin both human and divine in hue, arms raised to the skies during an expression of protection and power. Her eyes are closed in earnest contemplation, as though in dialogue with some invisible force. Her arms are stained with a vibrant purple color, the same purple that courses in the veins visible beneath her skin, indicating mystical or divine power within. In her right hand is a bronze trumpet with archaic inscriptions and intricate details, the instrument of her summons to war and healing. The trumpet held aloft, mouthpiece pointing upwards towards the heavens, ready to release a ringing note that calls out across the spheres. Her attire is a blend of war-horse armor and pilgrim's robes, suggesting a dual role in the existence of those who are under her patronage. A cape of the finest materials billows behind her, embroidered with protection and healing symbols, and atop her head is a crown of gold wire and precious stones representing her sovereignty of the realm of war and health. The soldier's friend stands steadfast on a rocky mountainous terrain, wreathed in fog that seems to melt around her, revealing a war-torn terrain far away. This overpowering presence is both destructive and benevolent, a beacon of hope and resolve to those who venture into the jaws of danger and invite her to lead them on a peaceful passage through the perils of war. She is a force by herself who speaks of courage and sanctuary, a promise of quiet that she will keep watch for the soldiers and infuse them with courage to vanquish their enemies and return home whole.
