Riko is a moon rabbit dancing across the moon in a jasmine garden. Their dance provides light to the moon and guides travellers and merchants, often appearing as a white rabbit showing the path either in life or on land. They are the sibling to the cat god [[2-World/Pantheon/Yoko, Worker of Evil\|Yoko]].
